# Great Books in Info

This is a repository where I'll store books that I've converted into info, I don't wave any copyright claims and if someone finds issue with this please kindly ask me to take the repository down. I only throw these up in case anybody else is interested. All the mistakes are my own.

## What is Info

Info was originally created by Richard Stallman and is the format which most of Emacs' documentation is written in. It is great because it breaks the text down into pieces and gives keystrokes so you can elegantly make your way through. For those of us who enjoy working in Emacs we find it inconvenient when we are forced to use another program. You can read pdfs and epubs but I think you'd be stretching it if you called the experience ideal. Also, to have the document just written as plain text in your buffer and refer to any menu with the click of a button is priceless. The fact that info separates the texts into sections and subsections makes it ideal for books which are divided and referred to in that way, the obvious example being the bible. They are also very easy to write thanks to org-mode.

## Getting Started

If you've never used info before the best place to start is the info manual. To start it in Emacs type C-h i m info <RET>. To invoke info by itself type C-h i, this will show you all the info documents installed on your computer. If you wish to read an info file that isn't installed on your system, which you'll probably want to do if you download anything from this repository, type C-u C-h i ~/info-file <RET>.
